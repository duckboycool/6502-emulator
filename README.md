# 6502-emulator

A C++ emulator of the 6502 microprocessor, known for its use in the NES, Apple II, Atari 2600, Commodore 64, and many more influential systems.

## Use
Currently, programs are hardcoded as a `code` variable, but in the future, you will be able to input either a filepath to an assembled binary file or a hex string as a command line option.

You will need to assemble your program from 6502 assembly before inputting it into `6502.exe`.
